= TROT

  ‘When running has devolved into a trot…

Testing is basically an embarrassingly parallel problem, but in reality we don't take advantage of this. Trot aims to solve this problem using the Test Anything Protocol. Trot takes a bag of TAP producers, runs them and either becomes a TAP producer itself or formats the output. This allows you to run all of your tests in parallel as long as they're a TAP producer.

== Example architecture

 python tests --TAP--.
                      \
 ruby tests --TAP-------> Trot -----.
                      /              \
 C tests --TAP-------'                \
                                       -----> Trot => Formatted goodness
                                      /
 remote tests --TAP--NETCAT--> Trot -'
